#### Let's give more to charity
In Peter Singer's compelling essay titled <i>Famine, Affluence and Morality</i>, he argues that most people in affluent countries are <i>morally obliged</i> to give way more money to charity than they currently do. Put very succinctly; he argues that if you can prevent something bad from happening, without having to sacrifice something of equally or similar moral importance, you ought to do it. This holds true regardless of your distance from the bad thing, whether other people could help, or whether you've already done your fair share. I previously wrote a [short summary]({% post_url 2020-02-05-Singer-Summary %}) of it, for a more elaborate explanation of his argument.   

The essay does a wonderful job substantiating its point. While many ethical theories are shrouded in vagueness or clouded with jargon, this one is not. If it were implemented, the world would surely be better off. It's easy to understand. Its message is short and powerful. 

As much as it is powerful, it is also awkward. Adhering to Singer's idea means turning your whole life upside down. If you believe in the truth of this essay but you haven't acted on it <i>yet</i>, every purchase you make will come with a sense of guilt. If you belong to that group, you will probably stay inspired for a couple of weeks. You'll tell your friends about it, and some of them might also read the essay. Eventually, life will continue as usual. While your mind gets occupied by new ideas, the unease you felt before at the thought of buying new stuff slowly diminishes as you forget about the urgency of Singer's message. 

That's what happened to me at least. I apparently need more reasons to buy less stuff <i>permanently</i>. My rationalization of it is that the continuous pull from advertisements which bombard us every moment of the day, is too large for Singer's essay to resist all by itself. It needs allies. 

#### Let's buy less stuff
There happens to be another movement that wants people to buy less stuff, and it also needs allies. It's called <i>minimalism</i>, and it's about being more mindful about the stuff you need, and the stuff you don't. It wants you to ask yourself if you <i>really</i> need this item and if it makes you happy. That seems like a good message in today's world. Some famous spokespeople of the movement are The Minimalists; two bloggers who made a couple of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3810760/">Netflix documentaries</a>, and Marie Kondo; famous for her books on tidying up your house.

Since then, the movement's motives have deteriorated. Slowly but surely, the emphasis shifted from an attitude towards consumption and lifestyle, to an aesthetic movement. Instead of trying to live with less stuff, minimalists increasingly urged you to <i>replace</i> your current stuff with other stuff that "looks minimal". Consider the commercial genious behind Marie Kondo. First she tells you to throw away stuff you don't need, only to <a target="_blank" href="https://konmari.com/">sell</a> you back her own stuff (that you don't need). Evidently, minimalism's initial, anti-consumerist agenda got hijacked by commercial enterprises. It couldn't resist the forces of the advertising industry.  

Why did that happen? To answer that, consider what happens if you subscribe to the ideas minimalism preaches: you buy less stuff, and you're left with more money. Because that money has no purpose yet, you're easily swayed to buy stuff with it. This is a major weak point, and we need to find that money a purpose to solve it. If we make Peter Singer and minimalism join forces, we have found that purpose. We now have a powerful pull away from buying new stuff, and a meaningful purpose for the money we're left with in the form of charity.
